These examples should give you a good starting point for understanding and implementing each of the Python fundamentals described below. Feel free to modify and experiment with them to deepen your understanding!

Imports: Importing modules and resources into your code.
Exceptions: Handling errors and unexpected situations.
Classes: Defining blueprints for objects with attributes (data) and methods (functions).
Private Attributes: Making data within a class inaccessible from outside.
Getters and Setters: Methods to control access and modification of private attributes.
Class Methods: Methods that operate on the class itself, not specific objects.
Static Methods: Functions that don't require an object or class instance to be called.
Inheritance: Creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones (superclasses).
Unittest: Writing automated tests to ensure your code functions as expected.
File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
